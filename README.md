# CPlusPlus
C++ code

# Contents
Different pieces of code, self made in **Visual C++ 2013/2015/2019.**
I tried to document the code as much as possible for future reference.

# Reference Sheet C++
There is a reference sheet in PDF format available based upon the books
**Aan de slag met C++ 7e druk** from GertJanLaan
**Een rondleiding door C++** from Bjarne Stroustrup

# Folders
If there is enough interest, I will use this paragraph to outline the use of the specific code.

## Future
I don't have any specific projects for short term needs.
